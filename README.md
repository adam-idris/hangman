# Hangman
    Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

    This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# Word List
    A predefined list of fruits are stored in the variable word_list. Using the random function, a random fruit is selected from the list. This will be the word that the user is trying to guess.

# Input
    The input function is used to ask the user to enter a single letter. An if statement is used to verify that the only one letter has been entered and that it is in the alphabet.
